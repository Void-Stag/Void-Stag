- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Heather
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in different areas of technology e.g programming, hardware maintenance, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Student @ DMU studying Applied Computing
- ðŸ“« My account will list everything I have worked on - Still working to upload and modify everything!

Note: One of the repositories - My Flask repositories are private due to some errors I have encountered with the files. 
I am doing my best to resolve this issue around my busy schedule. Sorry for the incovienece.
